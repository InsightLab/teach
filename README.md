# TEACH - Trajectory Embedding Comparator Benchmark

The problem of selecting the most appropriate trajectory embedding is challenging since the quality of the trajectory representation significantly influences the global performance of the machine learning model.

Based on the comparative analysis, it may be helpful to offer comparative experimental results between different embedding models for researchers to determine the most appropriate embedding for their neural network. We take inspiration from the natural language processing (NLP) domain, which provides different comparisons between word embedding vectors to ensure the quality of word representation before using it in a machine learning task. The evaluation methods are classified into two main categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic evaluation is independent of a specific task and seeks similarity and relatedness between words. Unlike the extrinsic comparison, the assessment is integrated into an NLP task. 

TEACH (Trajectory Embedding compArator benCHmark) assesses trajectory embeddings qualitatively to help researchers select a proper trajectory embedding representation before passing through a coupled neural network.
